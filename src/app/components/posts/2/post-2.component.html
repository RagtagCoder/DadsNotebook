            <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                <p>I would often look back at that fateful day in 2015, in my black gown and graduation hat
                    getting ready to walk on stage to receive my degree. I was going to be a Software Engineer, and 
                    it was almost impossible to contain my excitement!<br>
                    Of course unlike my classmates, I had already worked over 20 unskilled, mundane, manual labour, 
                     soul destroying jobs since leaving school, you see at the ripe age of 25 I decided I'd go back 
                     to school and chase a career in something I actually enjoy. <br>
                     I actually did it too, starting from ground zero as a <i>'trouble lad that was 
                    expelled from school at 13'</i> I got my GCSE's, then A Levels then onto University.
                </p>
                <p>Now don't get me wrong I'm not one of those people that think it was wasted, or that 
                    University is a rip off. For the first few years I LOVED my job, I was specialized and respected 
                    and the pay wasn't bad either. I wouldn't change my journey from unqualified layabout to 
                    Senior Engineer for the world. My problems came a few years into my career...
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Work life balance</h2>
                <p>It didn't even feel like 'work' at first, when you've experienced 18 hour shifts and laboured in 
                    the precast concrete industry, Software Engineering felt like I was getting paid to have fun. 
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life</blockquote>
                <p>What they don't tell you however, is that if you do what you enjoy 40 hours per week, year on year 
                    while having deadlines and brown nose managers, you slowly start to not enjoy it anymore.
                </p>
                <p>I changed company, multiple times actually. Became a subcontractor, then freelancer, then I changed sector 
                    (Finance, then Military, then Tourism, Then Healthcare etc), but it didn't make a difference.
                    I began to realise that I had just performed the same task and sat in the same meetings too many times,
                    and while it wasn't really 'hard' work like my grafting days, my drive to write code for other people was gone
                    and no amount of effort could change that.
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Empty inside</h2>
                <p>It is so hard to describe burnout, the only way I can put it to words is an empty feeling.
                    I sit at my desk with my 'to-do' list in front of me, but I just can't bring myself to do it.
                    I would wake up some mornings and think, "I'm going to knuckle down today and churn through
                    my work", next thing I know I'm watching a YouTube video explaining why farmers in the UK are 
                    having such a tough finance time lately.<br>
                    Anything and everything else is more interesting than my job, I would rather take a 40 minute
                    toilet break while doom scrolling Facebook, than write 100 lines of code to meet my deadlines.<br>
                    What the hell am I going to do? Years of studying, working late, gritting my teeth at infuriating 
                    colleagues and a monstrous student loan debt, I'm finally at the top of my career, and I hate it...
