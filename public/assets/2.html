<!-- 10 things I wish my dad had taught me -->

        Like many of you, my father was never around from an early age. You see my parents split when I was young,
        and between my father was either living far away or spending time in prison, I was all alone with just mum and my 4 sisters.
        While my mother did an amazing job under the circumstances, it often meant that I felt lost and had to learn many things the hard way.
        Almost all of you dads out there, like me, have probably had those moments where we wonder if we are enough, or even thoughts as dark
        as wondering if they would be better off without us. Let me just assure you right now, for better or worse, kids need their dad.

        Raising kids from a fathers perspective these days is... complicated. Finding the balance between making your kids tough enough
        to cope with the real world, and being a loving nurturing parent is like drink driving on uni-cycle while juggling hot coal. In the end 
        we are all going to get things wrong, it's human nature, but one thing I'm certain of is that as long as you are showing up and they know
        they are loved, you're on the right path.

        I had to learn some harsh lessons over the years, but this just means my son won't have to. Here are 10 things I wish my father had told me:

    <p>
         told me that boys have to be tough. Those words, along with my terrible role models on TV,
        meant that boys don't cry. Then years of school, youth club, football etc, only reinforced this too. Tears mean weakness, man up and walk it off.
        As I carried this into adulthood I became an angry shaken fizzy drink, years of suppressing every hurtful word and act from others just pushed aside
        and held in. It led me to lashing out at people who didn't deserve it, losing control of my anger at insignificant things and often landing me in a lot
        of trouble with other lads or even the police. It wasn't until I was in my mid 20's that I finally broke down, I was going through a breakup, but crying
        out 20 years worth of pain and tears.<br>
        To a degree my mother (and society) was right, as a man if you cry in public, it is regarded as weak or even pathetic, and believe me there are a lot
        of horrible people out there that will only make you feel worse. What
